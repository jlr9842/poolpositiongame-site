# poolposition.app

The public site for the Pool Position brand: Pool Position: ProSim (the game) and Pool Position: Scorebook.
Static pages on GitHub Pages, custom domain `poolposition.app` (DNS at GoDaddy; .app is HSTS-preloaded, HTTPS only).
`poolpositiongame.com` forwards to `https://poolposition.app/prosim/` and `poolpositionapp.com` to `https://poolposition.app/`
(GoDaddy domain forwarding, 301, not from this repo). Only the pages and images
live here; screenshots use sample data only.

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/` | Brand landing, both apps |
| `/prosim/`, `/prosim/privacy/`, `/prosim/support/` | ProSim |
| `/scorebook/`, `/scorebook/privacy/`, `/scorebook/support/` | Scorebook |
| `/t/<code>` | ProSim table invites (universal link / App Clip). No file per code: `404.html` shows the invite page for `/t/...` |
| `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` | applinks (`/t/*` → `com.joshramey.prosim`) and appclips (`com.joshramey.prosim.Clip`), team R344K83LVM. `.nojekyll` keeps `.well-known` published |

**Removing the Scorebook:** delete `scorebook/` and every block between `<!-- SCOREBOOK -->` and
`<!-- /SCOREBOOK -->` (`grep -rn SCOREBOOK .`).

**When the Scorebook is live:** replace the "Coming soon" pill in `scorebook/index.html` with its App Store link
(the comment there has the markup).

**When ProSim has an App Store ID:** uncomment the `apple-itunes-app` meta in `404.html` and `t/index.html`.

## Look and screenshots

Style A, "Night at the table" (Josh's pick, 2026-11-04): dark felt, Liquid Glass panels, gold accents (`style.css`).
Shots are from ProSim/Scorebook main in Release simulator builds (2026-11-04): iPhone 17 Pro, iPad Pro 13, iPhone Duo
(folded, open flat, book, laptop) and the Apple TV at 1080p. Palmer's is on the site by Josh's call, framed with no
alcohol branding (no COLD BEER sign or fridges) and not named as a partner. Sample names only; no song text.
Refresh the shots when the halls or controls change.
